# Progress Tracking Strategy

**Live research experiment in AI-native workflow orchestration and documentation**

---

## Experimental Nature

### **This is Active Research**
This progress tracking approach is a **live experiment** being developed and tested in real-time. We're figuring out what works through actual usage, not theoretical design.

**Expectations**:
- **Rapid Evolution**: This strategy will change significantly as we learn
- **Iterative Improvement**: Each session teaches us something new about what works
- **User-Driven Adaptation**: Real user feedback will reshape our approach
- **Experimental Mindset**: We're testing hypotheses, not implementing final solutions

### **Embrace Change and Diversity**
We **deliberately** expect this approach to evolve:
- **Multiple Modalities**: Text, voice, visual, collaborative - we'll adapt to what users prefer
- **Different Strategies**: Some users want detailed logs, others want minimal tracking
- **Tool Evolution**: New tools will require new documentation approaches
- **Community Innovation**: Community will develop better patterns than we can imagine

**Core Principle**: Start somewhere reasonable, learn rapidly, adapt continuously.

## Current Progress Tracking Strategy

### **Single Session File Approach**
For now, we're using a simple, flexible approach that can evolve:

#### **File Naming Convention**
- **Format**: `PROGRESS-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Examples**: `PROGRESS-2025-08-22.md`, `PROGRESS-2025-12-15.md`
- **Rationale**: Date-based for easy chronological organization

#### **Obsidian Note Format**
Using Obsidian-style Markdown with YAML frontmatter for structure:

```yaml
---
session-type: mcp-security-workflow
date: 2025-08-22
primary-goal: find-and-audit-web-search-server
deployment-context: enterprise-multi-user
tools-used: [mcpserver-finder, mcpserver-audit]
status: in-progress
created-files: [discovery-results.md, audit-report.md]

## Progress Tracking Philosophy

### **Dual Purpose Documentation**
The PROGRESS file serves as both:

#### 1. **Session Log** (Operational)
- **Chronological Record**: What happened when
- **Decision Tracking**: Why choices were made
- **Context Preservation**: Information needed to resume work
- **File Organization**: Central hub linking to all created outputs

#### 2. **Lab Notebook** (Research)
- **Experiment Documentation**: What approaches were tried
- **Result Analysis**: What worked, what didn't, why
- **Insight Capture**: Lessons learned and patterns discovered
- **Knowledge Building**: Contribute to understanding of effective workflows

### **Context Recovery Support**
Critical for AI workflows where context limits force restarts:

#### **Checkpoint Information**
- **Current State**: Where we are in the workflow
- **Key Decisions**: Important choices made along the way
- **Gathered Context**: User preferences, deployment scenario, requirements
- **Tool Results**: Summary of findings and their implications

#### **Resume Capability**
```markdown
## Context Recovery Section
**For AI Context Restart**: 

**Current Situation**: Evaluating web-search-mcp for enterprise deployment
**Key Context**: High security requirements, experienced team, audit found 2 critical issues
**Files to Review**: ./audit-report.md (critical findings), ./remediation-plan.md (next steps)
**Immediate Next Action**: Review fix recommendations for input validation bypass
```

---

## File Organization Strategy

### **User-Controlled Directory Structure**
Users create their own working directory, we populate with results:

```
user-chosen-directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROGRESS-2025-08-22.md          # Main session file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discovery-results.md            # mcpserver-finder outputs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audit-report-detailed.md        # Full security assessment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audit-summary.md                # Executive summary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ remediation-plan.md              # Fix recommendations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-considerations.md     # Operational security guidance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ supporting-files/               # Additional outputs as needed
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vulnerability-details/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tool-outputs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reference-materials/
```

### **Relative Linking Strategy**
All links in PROGRESS.md use relative paths:
```markdown
## Key Results
- **Server Discovery**: Found 3 candidates, recommended web-search-mcp-pro ([details](./discovery-results.md))
- **Security Assessment**: 2 critical issues identified ([full report](./audit-report-detailed.md), [summary](./audit-summary.md))
- **Remediation Plan**: Fixes prioritized by deployment context ([plan](./remediation-plan.md))
```

### **Portable Output**
Entire directory can be:
- **Shared** with team members or stakeholders
- **Archived** for future reference
- **Continued** in future sessions
- **Used as Input** for other tools or workflows

## Progress Documentation Patterns

### **Minimal Progress Pattern**
For simple, single-step workflows:
```yaml
---
session-type: quick-discovery
date: 2025-08-22
goal: find-web-search-server
status: completed
---

# Quick Discovery: Web Search MCP Server

# Enterprise Security Assessment: Customer Support MCP

## Session Overview
**Goal**: Prepare customer-support-mcp for enterprise deployment
**Context**: Multi-tenant SaaS environment, SOC2 compliance required
**Timeline**: 2-week security review process

## Progress Timeline

### Phase 1: Discovery ‚úÖ Completed
**10:00 - 10:30**: Server evaluation and selection
- Evaluated 5 customer support MCP servers
- Selected `enterprise-support-mcp` based on quality and security baseline
- **Output**: [Discovery report](./discovery-analysis.md)

### Phase 2: Security Assessment ‚úÖ Completed  
**10:30 - 12:00**: Comprehensive security audit
- Used mcpserver-audit + Semgrep + dependency scanning
- Found 3 critical, 7 high, 12 medium issues
- **Outputs**: [Detailed audit](./security-audit-full.md), [Executive summary](./security-summary.md)

### Phase 3: Remediation Planning üîÑ In Progress
**12:00 - ongoing**: Security fix planning and implementation
- Prioritized fixes based on enterprise deployment context
- Created remediation roadmap with timeline
- **Outputs**: [Remediation plan](./fix-roadmap.md), [Implementation guide](./fix-implementation.md)

### Phase 4: Deployment Security ‚è≥ Pending
- Deployment security configuration
- Monitoring and operational controls setup
- Compliance validation and documentation

## Key Findings
### Critical Security Issues
1. **Input Validation Bypass** - Customer data exposure risk ([details](./security-audit-full.md#critical-001))
2. **Insufficient Access Controls** - Multi-tenant isolation failure ([details](./security-audit-full.md#critical-002))
3. **Credential Management** - API keys stored in plaintext ([details](./security-audit-full.md#critical-003))

### Deployment Readiness Status
- **Current**: ‚ùå Not ready for enterprise deployment
- **With Critical Fixes**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Ready for limited pilot
- **With All Fixes**: ‚úÖ Ready for full enterprise deployment

## Next Session
When resuming work or hitting context limits:
1. **Review**: [Security summary](./security-summary.md) and [fix roadmap](./fix-roadmap.md)
2. **Continue**: Implement input validation fixes first (highest priority)
3. **Context**: Enterprise multi-user deployment, SOC2 compliance required

## Experiments and Insights
### What Worked Well
- Parallel security scanning (audit + semgrep) provided comprehensive coverage
- Enterprise context helped prioritize findings effectively
- Documentation format makes handoffs smooth

### What Could Improve
- Initial server selection process could be more security-focused
- Need better integration between audit findings and fix recommendations
- Compliance mapping needs more systematic approach

## Future TODO
- Develop MCP logging server for better session management and timestamps
- Create compliance-specific assessment workflows
- Build automated fix validation processes
```

This approach:
- **Flexible**: Works for simple or complex workflows
- **Recoverable**: Easy to resume after context limits
- **Linkable**: Everything connected through relative links
- **Evolutionary**: Can adapt as we learn what works
- **Self-Documenting**: Captures both results and process insights

Should I create this **PROGRESS.md template document** that explains this strategy and provides examples?
