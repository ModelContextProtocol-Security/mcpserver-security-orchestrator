# Dynamic Tool Discovery

**Finding, evaluating, and integrating new MCP security tools as the ecosystem evolves**

---

## Overview

This document outlines the orchestrator's approach to discovering, evaluating, and integrating new tools in the rapidly evolving MCP security ecosystem. Rather than relying on static tool lists, we implement dynamic discovery mechanisms that adapt to ecosystem growth.

**Core Philosophy**: Stay current with the ecosystem through systematic discovery, community-driven evaluation, and intelligent integration.

---

## Discovery Principles

### 1. **Continuous Discovery**
- Actively search for new tools as they emerge
- Monitor community developments and contributions
- Track tool evolution and improvement patterns
- Adapt to changing ecosystem landscape

### 2. **Community-Driven Evaluation**
- Leverage community knowledge and experience
- Use collective intelligence for tool assessment
- Share discovery findings with the ecosystem
- Build on community feedback and recommendations

### 3. **Intelligent Integration**
- Assess tool capabilities and fit automatically
- Determine optimal integration patterns
- Handle new tool types gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows

### 4. **Quality-Focused Approach**
- Prioritize tool effectiveness and reliability
- Consider maintenance status and community support
- Evaluate integration complexity and benefits
- Balance innovation with stability
