## Core Workflow Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Discovery → Assessment → Decision**
**Scenario**: "I need an MCP server for [specific functionality]"

#### Workflow Steps
```
1. DISCOVERY
   └── Use mcpserver-finder to discover and evaluate candidates
   
2. SECURITY ASSESSMENT  
   ├── Option A: Quick automated scan with mighty-security
   ├── Option B: Educational manual analysis with mcpserver-audit  
   └── Option C: Both (mighty-security first, then mcpserver-audit for learning)
   
3. DECISION POINT
   ├── Safe to use → Deploy with standard security
   ├── Needs fixes → Route to mcpserver-builder
   ├── Needs hardening → Route to mcpserver-operator  
   └── Too risky → Return to discovery for alternatives
```

#### Context Adaptations
- **Local Use**: Light assessment, focus on functionality
- **Remote Single-User**: Basic security assessment, standard deployment
- **Remote Multi-User**: Comprehensive assessment, likely needs fixes or hardening
- **Enterprise**: Full security audit, almost certainly needs remediation

#### Tool Synergies
- **Finder provides context** to audit (deployment scenario, quality baseline)
- **Audit findings inform** builder (specific vulnerabilities to fix)
- **Audit findings inform** operator (compensating controls needed)

#### Example Usage
```
# Phase 1: Discovery
read ../../mcpserver-finder/prompts/main-prompt.md and find web search MCP servers for enterprise deployment

# Phase 2: Assessment (choose approach based on context and learning goals)
# Option A: Quick automated scan
python3 mighty_mcp.py check https://github.com/[chosen-server]

# Option B: Educational manual analysis
read ../../mcpserver-audit/prompts/main-prompt.md and assess security of [chosen server]

# Option C: Combined approach
python3 mighty_mcp.py check https://github.com/[chosen-server] --llm
# Then: read ../../mcpserver-audit/prompts/main-prompt.md and analyze mighty-security findings for [chosen server]

# Phase 3: Decision
[Based on findings, route to builder for fixes OR operator for hardening]
```

---

### **Pattern 2: Assessment → Remediation → Validation**
**Scenario**: "I have this MCP server, how do I make it secure?"

#### Workflow Steps
```
1. SECURITY ASSESSMENT
   ├── Quick scan: mighty-security for automated vulnerability detection
   ├── Deep analysis: mcpserver-audit for educational security assessment
   └── Recommended: mighty-security first, then mcpserver-audit for learning/validation
   
2. REMEDIATION PLANNING
   ├── Critical/High issues → mcpserver-builder for fixes
   ├── Deployment concerns → mcpserver-operator for controls
   └── Acceptable risk → Document and monitor
   
3. VALIDATION
   └── Re-assess with mcpserver-audit to verify improvements
```

#### Decision Logic
- **Fixable Issues**: Code vulnerabilities → Builder
- **Environmental Issues**: Deployment risks → Operator  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Some fixes + some operational controls
- **Risk Acceptance**: Document residual risk and monitoring

#### Example Usage
```
# Phase 1: Assessment (recommended: start with automated scan)
# Quick automated vulnerability detection
python3 mighty_mcp.py check https://github.com/my-org/my-custom-server --llm

# Educational manual analysis (can analyze mighty-security findings)
read ../../mcpserver-audit/prompts/main-prompt.md and audit security of my-custom-server

# Phase 2: Remediation (based on findings)
read ../../mcpserver-builder/prompts/main-prompt.md and fix vulnerabilities: [list]
# OR
read ../../mcpserver-operator/prompts/main-prompt.md and secure deployment for: [server with known issues]

# Phase 3: Validation
read ../../mcpserver-audit/prompts/main-prompt.md and re-assess security after fixes
```

---

### **Pattern 3: Build → Audit → Deploy**
**Scenario**: "I'm building a new MCP server, how do I do it securely?"

#### Workflow Steps
```
1. SECURE DEVELOPMENT
   └── Use mcpserver-builder for secure development guidance
   
2. SECURITY VALIDATION
   └── Use mcpserver-audit to validate security implementation
   
3. SECURE DEPLOYMENT
   └── Use mcpserver-operator for deployment security
```

#### Development Integration
- **Design Phase**: Security-by-design principles from builder
- **Implementation Phase**: Secure coding practices and patterns
- **Testing Phase**: Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- **Deployment Phase**: Operational security and monitoring

#### Example Usage
```
# Phase 1: Secure Development
read ../../mcpserver-builder/prompts/main-prompt.md and guide secure development of [new server concept]

# Phase 2: Security Validation
read ../../mcpserver-audit/prompts/main-prompt.md and validate security of newly built server

# Phase 3: Secure Deployment  
read ../../mcpserver-operator/prompts/main-prompt.md and plan secure deployment
```

### **Pattern 4: Automated Pre-screening → Educational Deep-Dive** 
**Scenario**: "I want to efficiently screen servers and learn from interesting findings"

#### Workflow Steps
```
1. AUTOMATED BATCH SCREENING
   └── Use mighty-security to quickly scan multiple server candidates
   
2. TRIAGE AND PRIORITIZATION
   ├── Review automated findings for severity and interest level
   ├── Filter false positives based on context
   └── Select servers with educational value or concerning findings
   
3. EDUCATIONAL DEEP-DIVE
   └── Use mcpserver-audit to manually analyze selected findings
   
4. PATTERN LEARNING
   ├── Compare automated vs manual findings
   ├── Build understanding of vulnerability patterns
   └── Improve ability to assess automated scanner results
```

#### Research/Beta Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Screen many servers quickly with automation
- **Learning**: Focus educational time on most interesting cases  
- **Validation**: Compare automated vs manual assessment results
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to identify reliable vs unreliable automated findings

#### Example Usage
```bash
# Phase 1: Batch Screening
for server in candidate-list; do
    python3 mighty_mcp.py check $server --llm > results-$server.txt
done

# Phase 2: Triage (review automated results)
# Select servers with:
# - High-severity findings that need validation
# - Interesting patterns worth learning from  
# - Unexpected results (false positives/negatives)

# Phase 3: Educational Analysis
read ../../mcpserver-audit/prompts/main-prompt.md and analyze these mighty-security findings for [selected-server]: [paste results]

# Phase 4: Learning Capture
# Document: What did mighty-security get right/wrong?
# How accurate were the severity assessments?
# What patterns can improve future automated screening?
```

#### Research Questions for This Pattern
- How reliable are mighty-security's severity assessments?
- What types of vulnerabilities does it miss vs over-report?
- Can we develop hybrid approaches that combine both tools effectively?
- What validation patterns help identify false positives quickly?

## Educational Workflow Patterns

### **Pattern 5: Learning-Focused Discovery**
**Scenario**: "I want to learn about MCP security while finding/evaluating servers"

#### Educational Integration
```
ANY CORE WORKFLOW + Educational Focus:
├── Start with learning objectives and skill assessment
├── Use educational modes of all tools
├── Focus on teaching concepts through practical application  
├── Build understanding progressively across tool usage
└── Capture learning outcomes and skill development
```

#### Example Approach
```
# Educational Discovery
read ../../mcpserver-finder/prompts/main-prompt.md and teach me server evaluation while finding [specific need]

# Educational Assessment
read ../../mcpserver-audit/prompts/main-prompt.md and teach me security assessment using [chosen server]
```

## Multi-Tool Coordination Patterns

### **Parallel Assessment Pattern**
**Scenario**: Comprehensive security evaluation using multiple tools

#### Coordination Strategy
```
PARALLEL TOOL USAGE:
├── mighty-security (automated MCP-specific vulnerability detection)
├── mcpserver-audit (educational manual assessment + validation)
├── Third-party static analysis (Semgrep, CodeQL for additional coverage)
├── Dependency scanners (npm audit, Snyk for supply chain security)
└── Specialized tools (based on server technology stack)

SYNTHESIS:
├── Correlate findings across tools
├── Deduplicate similar vulnerabilities  
├── Prioritize based on deployment context
└── Create unified security posture assessment
```

### **Iterative Improvement Pattern**
**Scenario**: Continuous improvement of server security

#### Iteration Cycle
```
1. BASELINE ASSESSMENT
   └── Initial security audit and quality evaluation
   
2. TARGETED IMPROVEMENT  
   ├── Address highest-priority issues first
   ├── Use builder for code fixes
   ├── Use operator for deployment controls
   └── Apply incremental improvements
   
3. RE-ASSESSMENT
   └── Validate improvements and identify remaining issues
   
4. REPEAT
   └── Continue until acceptable security posture achieved
```

## Workflow Decision Points

### **When to Use Builder vs Operator**
```
DECISION LOGIC:
├── Code-Level Issues Found
│   ├── Input validation, authentication, authorization → Builder
│   ├── Insecure coding patterns, vulnerability patterns → Builder
│   └── Architecture or design flaws → Builder
├── Deployment-Level Concerns
│   ├── Network exposure, access controls → Operator
│   ├── Monitoring, logging, incident response → Operator
│   └── Infrastructure security, isolation → Operator
├── Both Needed
│   ├── Comprehensive security issues → Builder first, then Operator
│   ├── Timeline constraints → Operator for immediate risk reduction
│   └── Compliance requirements → Usually both Builder and Operator
└── Neither Sufficient
    ├── Fundamental security flaws → Don't use server
    ├── Architecture problems → Major redesign needed
    └── Unmaintained/abandoned → Find alternative server
```

### **When to Loop Back to Discovery**
```
DISCOVERY RE-ENTRY POINTS:
├── Unacceptable Security Risk
│   └── Current server too risky, need alternatives
├── Missing Functionality
│   └── Server doesn't meet requirements after evaluation
├── Maintenance Concerns  
│   └── Server quality issues, need better-maintained alternative
├── Better Options Available
│   └── Discovery of superior alternatives during assessment
└── User Preference Change
    └── Requirements or context evolved during workflow
```
