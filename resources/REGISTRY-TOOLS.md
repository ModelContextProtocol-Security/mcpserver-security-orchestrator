#### **MCP Eval** (Hosted Compatibility & Capability Testing)
**Purpose**: Evaluate MCP servers for client compatibility, tool coverage, and basic performance

**Location**:
- **Hosted App**: https://www.mcpevals.ai/
- **Repo**: https://github.com/scorecard-ai/mcp-eval

**Maturity**: ðŸš€ **Production** - Hosted service with self-host option

**Good At**:
- Client compatibility matrix (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor)
- OAuth 2.0 flow validation and testing
- Tool discovery with intelligent argument generation
- Performance metrics with real-time streaming logs
- One-click testing and easy report sharing

**Not Good At**:
- Security vulnerability scanning or code-level analysis (use mcpserver-audit and scanners)
- Deep protocol fuzzing or adversarial testing
- Offline/batch CLI workflows (use self-host/API if needed)

**Known Limitations**:
- Requires accessible server URL or proper OAuth configuration
- Generated test arguments may need manual adjustment for highly custom schemas
- Focused on compatibility and behavior, not security posture

**Works Well With**:
- **mcpserver-finder**: Screen discovered candidates for compatibility and readiness
- **mcpserver-audit**: Use as a preflight/regression check before/after security audits
- **mighty-security / other scanners**: Complement with vulnerability scanning for risk assessment

**Typical Usage** (Hosted):
```
1) Visit https://www.mcpevals.ai/
2) Paste the MCP server URL (OAuth-supported)
3) Run evaluation and export/share the report
```

**Outputs Captured**:
- Pass/fail per client (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor)
- Tool-level success/error rates and logs
- Response time metrics (e.g., p50/p95) per tool
- OAuth/authorization flow results and errors

### **Security Assessment Tools**

#### **mighty-security** (Third-Party MCP Scanner)
**Purpose**: Automated MCP server vulnerability scanning and detection

**Location**: 
- **Repo**: `https://github.com/NineSunsInc/mighty-security`
- **Tool**: `python3 mighty_mcp.py check <server-url>`
- **Setup**: Requires Python 3.13+, optional Cerebras API key for LLM analysis

**Maturity**: ðŸš€ **Production** - Actively maintained, claims 500+ servers scanned in wild

**Good At**:
- Automated vulnerability detection (command injection, SSRF, credential theft, path traversal)
- Multi-language analysis (Python/JS/TS/Go/Rust) 
- ML/LLM-enhanced pattern recognition with Cerebras integration
- Production-ready CI/CD integration (returns exit codes)
- Web dashboard for results visualization and monitoring
- Real-world vulnerability patterns from actual MCP server analysis

**Not Good At**:
- Educational explanation of vulnerabilities (use mcpserver-audit for learning)
- Perfect accuracy (75-85% detection rate, ~5% false positives acknowledged)
- Obfuscated or heavily transformed code detection
- Runtime protection (basic monitoring only)

**Known Limitations**:
- Third-party tool - we haven't independently validated their vulnerability claims
- Newer tool - long-term maintenance and community support unknown
- May have different security philosophy than our educational approach

**Research/Beta Integration**:
- **Quick Pre-screening**: Run mighty-security before manual educational analysis
- **Bulk Assessment**: Scan multiple discovered servers efficiently  
- **Validation**: Compare automated findings with our manual assessment results
- **Learning**: Study their detection patterns to improve our own checks

**Works Well With**:
- **mcpserver-finder**: Pre-screen discovered servers for obvious vulnerabilities
- **mcpserver-audit**: Use automated findings as input for educational security analysis
- **mcpserver-builder**: Feed automated vulnerability findings into remediation planning

**Typical Usage** (Research):
```bash
# Basic automated scan
python3 mighty_mcp.py check https://github.com/some/mcp-server

# Enhanced with LLM analysis  
python3 mighty_mcp.py check https://github.com/some/mcp-server --llm

# Integration with our educational tools
mighty-security scan â†’ mcpserver-audit manual analysis â†’ mcpserver-builder fixes
```

**Research Questions**:
- How do their automated findings compare with our manual educational assessments?
- Can we learn from their vulnerability patterns to improve our own detection?
- What's the false positive rate on servers we know are safe?
- How does their approach complement our educational methodology?

- Community contribution and collaboration

### **Dynamic Discovery**
- Use mcpserver-finder to discover new security tools periodically
- Monitor GitHub, package repositories, and community resources
- Evaluate emerging tools using established assessment criteria
- Integrate promising tools into workflows and recommendations

### **Quality Standards**

- **Maintained**: Evidence of active maintenance and community support
- **Secure**: Tool itself must meet security standards
- **Integrable**: Must work reasonably well with orchestration approach
