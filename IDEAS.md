## MCP Tool Ideas

### **Lab Notebook / Logging MCP Server**
**Purpose**: Dedicated MCP server for session management, logging, and progress tracking

**Capabilities**:
- **Structured Logging**: Automatic timestamps, session tracking, file organization
- **Search and Retrieval**: Find previous sessions, results, and insights
- **Progress Analytics**: Track workflow effectiveness, learning progress, tool usage patterns
- **Context Management**: Better handling of context limits and session recovery
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user session sharing and collaborative documentation

**Why Needed**:
- Current PROGRESS.md approach is manual and limited
- Need better timestamps and structured data capture
- Session recovery after context limits is crucial
- Analytics would help improve orchestration patterns

**Integration Points**:
- All orchestrator workflows could log to this server
- Could provide session analytics and workflow optimization
- Enable better context recovery and session management
- Support collaborative security assessments
