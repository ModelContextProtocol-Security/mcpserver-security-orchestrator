# Orchestration Patterns

**Common workflow templates and decision trees for intelligent MCP security orchestration**

---

## Overview

This document defines reusable orchestration patterns that coordinate tools, manage context, and guide users through MCP security workflows. Each pattern provides decision trees, tool coordination strategies, and adaptation mechanisms for different user contexts.

**Philosophy**: Flexible patterns that adapt to user needs, deployment contexts, and available tools while maintaining consistent orchestration principles.

---

## Core Orchestration Principles

### 1. **Context-First Approach**
- Always gather deployment context early (4-level framework)
- Adapt security priorities based on deployment scenario
- Maintain context throughout the workflow
- Use context to inform tool selection and coordination

### 2. **User-Centered Adaptation**
- Assess user experience level and learning preferences
- Adapt communication style and depth accordingly
- Provide choice between educational and execution modes
- Respect user time constraints and objectives

### 3. **Tool Intelligence**
- Select best available tools for specific tasks
- Coordinate multiple tools when beneficial
- Handle tool failures gracefully with fallbacks
- Synthesize outputs from multiple sources

### 4. **Continuous Learning**
- Capture user feedback and preferences
- Learn from workflow effectiveness
- Adapt patterns based on real-world usage
- Improve orchestration through experience

## Primary Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: DISCOVERY-DRIVEN WORKFLOW
*"I need an MCP server that does X"*

#### Workflow Overview
User has functional requirements but no specific server in mind. Orchestrator guides discovery, evaluation, and selection process.

#### Decision Tree

```
START: User expresses functional need
│
├── CONTEXT GATHERING
│   ├── What functionality do you need?
│   ├── What's your deployment scenario? (4-level)
│   ├── What's your experience level?
│   ├── Do you want to learn or just get results?
│   └── What are your time constraints?
│
├── DISCOVERY PHASE
│   ├── High Experience + Execution Mode
│   │   └── Run mcpserver-finder + parallel third-party discovery
│   ├── Low Experience + Educational Mode
│   │   └── Guided discovery with teaching
│   └── Hybrid Mode
│       └── Efficient discovery with key learning points
│
├── EVALUATION PHASE
│   ├── Local Deployment (Level 1)
│   │   └── Focus on functionality, basic quality checks
│   ├── Remote Single-User (Level 2)
│   │   └── Add basic security assessment
│   ├── Remote Multi-User (Level 3)
│   │   └── Comprehensive security + quality evaluation
│   └── Enterprise (Level 4)
│       └── Full audit + compliance considerations
│
├── DECISION SUPPORT
│   ├── Compare candidates systematically
│   ├── Explain trade-offs and recommendations
│   ├── Handle "no good options" scenario
│   └── Provide implementation guidance
│
└── HANDOFF TO IMPLEMENTATION
    ├── Direct use (low-risk scenarios)
    ├── Security remediation (issues found)
    └── Deployment guidance (higher-risk scenarios)
```

#### Tool Coordination Strategy

**Phase 1: Discovery**
- **Primary**: mcpserver-finder with appropriate prompt
- **Secondary**: Third-party discovery tools in parallel
- **Fallback**: Manual search with orchestrator guidance

**Phase 2: Security Evaluation**

- **Educational Mode**: Guided security learning throughout

**Phase 3: Decision Support**
- **Synthesis**: Combine discovery and security findings
- **Risk Analysis**: Context-appropriate risk assessment
- **Recommendation**: Clear guidance with reasoning

#### Adaptation Points
- **Experience Level**: Adjust explanation depth and teaching moments
- **Time Constraints**: Skip educational content in time-critical scenarios
- **Risk Tolerance**: Scale security assessment based on deployment context
- **Learning Preference**: Switch between educational and execution modes
