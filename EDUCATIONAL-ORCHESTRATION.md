# Educational Orchestration

**Coordinating learning experiences across the MCP security ecosystem**

---

## Overview

This document outlines how the orchestrator coordinates educational experiences across multiple tools, adapts to different learning preferences, and builds security expertise progressively. The orchestrator serves as the learning experience manager, deciding when and how to integrate education into workflows.

**Core Philosophy**: Meet learners where they are, teach through doing, and build independent capability over time.

---

## Educational Principles

### 1. **Learner-Centered Adaptation**
- Assess and respect individual learning preferences
- Adapt teaching methods to experience level and context
- Provide choice between educational and execution modes
- Build on existing knowledge and experience

### 2. **Progressive Skill Building**
- Start with fundamentals and build complexity gradually
- Connect new concepts to practical application
- Develop transferable skills and mental models
- Enable independent problem-solving over time

### 3. **Multi-Modal Teaching**
- Support diverse learning styles and preferences
- Combine explanation, demonstration, and hands-on practice
- Use multiple reinforcement approaches
- Accommodate different accessibility needs

### 4. **Contextual Relevance**
- Connect learning to immediate practical needs
- Use real-world examples and scenarios
- Focus on skills that transfer to user's context
- Balance depth with practical application

## Learning Experience Framework

### 1. **Learning Mode Selection**

#### Mode Determination Process
```
LEARNING MODE SELECTION:

├── Context Analysis
│   ├── Time pressure and urgency
│   ├── Task complexity and learning opportunities
│   ├── User experience level in domain
│   └── Stakes and risk level of current task
├── Educational Value Assessment
│   ├── Learning opportunity richness

    ├── Full Educational Mode (deep learning focus)
    ├── Hybrid Mode (learn while doing)
    ├── Execution Mode (get work done efficiently)
    └── Adaptive Mode (switch based on context)
```

#### Educational Mode Characteristics

**Full Educational Mode**
